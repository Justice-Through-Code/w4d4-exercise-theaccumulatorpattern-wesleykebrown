'''
    You are given a list of temperature readings in Celsius for a week. Your task is to implement a function that calculates and returns the average temperature for the week. To achieve this, you will use the accumulator pattern to accumulate the sum of temperatures and then calculate the average.

    Input

    A list temperatures containing n floating-point numbers representing the temperature readings for the week.
    (1 <= n <= 7, -20 <= temperatures[i] <= 40)
    
    Input Example
    temperatures = [20.5, 22.0, 18.5, 25.5, 26.0, 23.5, 19.0]

    Output

    A single floating-point number representing the calculated average temperature.
    Example Output
    22.357142857142858
